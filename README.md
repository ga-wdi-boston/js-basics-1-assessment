# Assessment for JavaScript Fundamentals

You have 30 minutes

## Instructions

Fork, clone, branch (response), and npm install.

Follow the prompts below and complete each question.  You may use any resource, other than someone else in the classroom, to help you complete this assessment.

You should save your answers in this README.md file, except for your answer to question 5 which should be saved in the file `assessment.js`.

## Question 1

Please list the JavaScript primitives and give one example of each.

Number (1, -0)
Boolean (true, false)
String ('yo, yoyo')
Null (null)
Undefined (Undefined)

## Question 2

```js
var c = 5;
var d = 2;
c = c + d;
```

After this code executes, what is the value of c?  Please identify the operators in the last line of this program `c = c + d;` and explain what they do.

7
c =(gets, defined as) c +(sum) d

## Question 3

```js
var x = 4;
var y = 3;
x = y;
y = 10;
```

After each line of code executes, what are the values of x and y?  Do the variables change?  Do their values?

x = 3
y = 10
The variables do NOT change, but their values DO change.

## Question 4

```js
var weather;
weather = "sunny";
weather === "sunny";
```

What are the values of these expressions?  Explain your answers.

First, weather is declared as a variable = undefined.
Next, for weather = "sunny" (weather is defined with string "sunny").
Then the final expression asks "is weather equal to sunny?" and
it evalutes the boolean 'true'.

## Question 5

```js
//cleared
```

Change the code from this question so that it tests for a number betwen 1 and 10 instead of a string.  Save it in the file called `assessment.js`.  You can test the code with `node assessment.js` in your Terminal.
