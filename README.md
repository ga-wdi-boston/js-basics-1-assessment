# Diagnostic for JavaScript Fundamental

You have 30 minutes

## Instructions

Fork, clone, branch (response), and npm install.

Follow the prompts below and complete each question.  You may use any resource, other than someone else in the classroom, to help you complete this diagnostic.

You should save your answers in this README.md file, except for your answer to question 5 which should be saved in the file `bin/diagnostic.js`.

Assume all code executes in strict mode.

## Question 1

5 Primitives:
 - Number;
 - Boolean;
 - String;
 - Undefined;
 - Null;

## Question 2

```js
let c = 5;
let d = 2;
c = c + d;

```

After this code executes, what is the value of c?  Please identify the operators in the last line of this program `c = c + d;` and explain what they do.

c = 7
The assignment (=) operator evaluates from right to left and assigns whatever is on the right side of the equal sign to what is on the left.
The addition (+) operator adds numeric values and concatenates strings.

## Question 3

```js
let x = 4;
let y = 3;
x = y;
y = 10;
```

After each line of code executes, what are the values of x and y?  Do the variables change?  Do their values?

The variables do not change, however, their values do. x is assigned the value of y, which is 3,
and then y is then assigned a value of 10.


## Question 4

```js
let weather;
weather = "sunny";
weather === "sunny";
```

What are the values of these expressions?  Explain your answers.

weather has been assigned the string of "sunny"; thus when weather is called the
variable will return "sunny".
The second expression will evaluate to true. The strict equality operator will
a boolean value and because both sides of the equality are true, the expression is
true.

## Question 5

```js
//We'll learn about require later in the course
const ask = require('../lib/ask.js');

let answer = 'not empty';

while (answer !== '') {
  answer = ask("Guess my secret? ");
  if (answer === 'SeCrEt') {
   console.log("You guessed it!");
   break;
  }
}
```

Change the code from this question so that it tests for a number of your choice between 1 and 10 instead of the string `'SeCrEt'`.  If `answer` isn't >= 1 and <= 10, use `console.log` to display a message saying that the guess needs to be between 1 and 10.  Save your code in the file called `bin/diagnostic.js`.  You can test the code with `node bin/diagnostic.js` in your Terminal.
