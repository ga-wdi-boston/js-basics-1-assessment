# Assessment for JavaScript Fundamentals

You have 30 minutes

## Instructions

Fork, clone, branch (response), and npm install.

Follow the prompts below and complete each question.  You may use any resource, other than someone else in the classroom, to help you complete this assessment.

You should save your answers in this README.md file, except for your answer to question 5 which should be saved in the file `assessment.js`.

## Question 1

Please list the JavaScript primitives and give one example of each.

number ex/ 0, NaN, infinity
string ex/ "What up, dog?"
boolean ex/ true, false
null ex/ null
undefined ex/ undefined


## Question 2

```js
var c = 5;
var d = 2;
c = c + d;
```

After this code executes, what is the value of c?  Please identify the operators in the last line of this program `c = c + d;` and explain what they do.

c is 7 at the end
last line does this: take c which is 5 and add d which is 2 which gets you 7 and store that back into c so c become 7

## Question 3

```js
var x = 4;
var y = 3;
x = y;
y = 10;
```

After each line of code executes, what are the values of x and y?  Do the variables change?  Do their values?

x is 3
y is 10
variables didn't change but the values did.  x's value changed from 4 to 3 and y's value changed from 3 to 10

## Question 4

```js
var weather;
weather = "sunny";
weather === "sunny";
```

What are the values of these expressions?  Explain your answers.

weather's value is "sunny"
and the boolean evaluates to true
var weather; declares variable named weather
weather = "sunny"; stores string "sunny" in weather
weather === "sunny"; evaluates to true because it passes the strict equivalance test.

## Question 5

```js
//We'll learn about require later in the course
var ask = require('./ask.js');

var answer = 'not empty';

while (answer !== '' && answer !== '8') {
  answer = ask("Guess my number between 1 and 10? ");
}
```

Change the code from this question so that it tests for a number betwen 1 and 10 instead of a string.  Save it in the file called `assessment.js`.  You can test the code with `node assessment.js` in your Terminal.
