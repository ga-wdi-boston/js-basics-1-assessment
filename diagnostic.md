# JS Basics Diagnostic

You should save your answers in this Diagnostic.md file, except for your answer to
question 5 which should be saved in the file `bin/diagnostic.js`.

Assume all code executes in strict mode.

## Question 1

Please list the JavaScript primitives and give one example of each.

//integer, string, boolean, undefined, null
//   9,     "word",  true,  undefined, value is null but its still an object

## Question 2

```js
let c = 5
let d = 2
c = c + d

```

After this code executes, what is the value of c?  Please identify the operators in the last line of this program `c = c + d` and explain what they do.

c = 5
c = 5 + 2
  = 7
 c and d are the variables and 5 and 2 are the values. + and = are the operators.

## Question 3

```js
let x = 4
let y = 3
x = y
y = 10
```

After each line of code executes, what are the values of x and y?  Do the variables change?  Do their values?

x = 3
y = 10
Variables dont change, only their values do.


## Question 4

```js
let weather
weather = "sunny"
weather === "sunny"
```

What do these expressions evaluate to?  Explain your answers.

in this example the variable would be the weather so the values would be sunny since its on the right side of the =.

## Question 5

```js
//We'll learn about require later in the course
const ask = require('../lib/ask.js')

let answer = 'not empty'

while (answer !== '') {
  answer = ask("Guess my secret? ")
  if (answer === 'SeCrEt') {
   console.log("You guessed it!")
   break
  }
}
```

Change the code from this question so that it tests for a number of your choice
between 1 and 10 instead of the string `'SeCrEt'`.  If `answer` isn't >= 1 and
<= 10, use `console.log` to display a message saying that the guess needs to
be between 1 and 10.  Save your code in the file called `bin/diagnostic.js`.
You can test the code with `node bin/diagnostic.js` in your Terminal.
