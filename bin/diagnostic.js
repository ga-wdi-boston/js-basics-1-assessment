// Change the code from this question so that it tests for a number of your choice
// between 1 and 10 instead of the string `'SeCrEt'`.  If `answer` isn't >= 1 and
// <= 10, use `console.log` to display a message saying that the guess needs to
// be between 1 and 10.  Save your code in the file called `bin/diagnostic.js`.
// You can test the code with `node bin/diagnostic.js` in your Terminal.
